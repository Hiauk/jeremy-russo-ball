            My painting methodology provokes interactions between a surface and applications of paint or ink.
        </p>

        <p>
            In my work, my mark-making acts as a visual metaphor representing both the commonality in the use of early
            marks
            shared by us all, and the uniqueness of expression made by each individual.
        </p>

        <p>
            I paint on a diverse range of surfaces, observing and responding to how each combination of chosen media
            behaves and
            interacts with each other. My intention is to enable the qualities of the various materials to emerge that
            relate
            directly to the degrees of control, intervention or chance that I am able to influence. I change the type,
            consistency and colour of the paint or ink, its placement and its volume, whilst chance might impact through
            elements such as air currents, vibrations, atmospheric conditions and gravity; these exert their own unique
            influence over the media to which I respond to and incorporate into my compositions, in a continuous and
            fluid
            dialogue.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the root of my work is the cross-pollination of Eastern and Western philosophy and visual culture.
            Research into
            the work and methods of Mono-Ha, Gutai, Dansaekhwa, Shodo (Japanese Calligraphy) and Lee Ufan in particular
            have
            informed and influenced my brush marksâ€™ gestural intent. Inspired by Eastern traditions, areas of unpainted
            surface
            are also an integral part of my work. Study of the work of artists including Callum Innes, Fiona Rae,
            Jessica
            Stockholder and Daniel Buren has also contributed significantly to the refinement of my painting process and
            presentation ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
            I investigate installation spaces within which to locate my paintings.
        </p>

        <p>
            I use mirrored surfaces and suspended work to visually break up the white cube, generating the illusion of
            space,
            allowing the viewer to simultaneously experience complete or incomplete reflections and combinations of
            alignments
            of the curated works, encouraging curiosity, contemplation and interaction with the surrounding physical
            space.
